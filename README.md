# Web Development Intern at Code Alpha
Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I've documented my journey as a web development intern at Code Alpha. This collection of projects demonstrates my evolving skills and passion for web development. Starting with a versatile Multi Survey Form, I showcased proficiency in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, enabling seamless survey response delivery via PHP. I then fortified this project by integrating Google's reCAPTCHA service, emphasizing my commitment to security. Lastly, I ventured into the world of web design, creating a clone of the Netflix webpage, and showcasing my design and layout skills. These projects collectively illustrate my growth from a learner to a proficient web developer, providing unique insights into my web development journey.
